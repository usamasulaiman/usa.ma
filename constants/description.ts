  work: "My name is Usama, and I am web engineer. I love code and design and have years of experience in modern web development architectures. </br></br> Recently, I've been working at a scaling startup, solving ever-changing product problems that come with different stages of going from conceptualisation to growth. </br></br> I sometimes write about my experiences and dabble into personal projects which you can find more on, on Github. </br></br> Before this, I've worked as a UX designer, sales and management, interned as a writer/journalist for a national daily, and a digitiser.</br></br>",
  general: "I am Usama, muslim by faith, a web engineer by profession, and a generalist at heart. I love code, design and writing. </br></br> I come from Delhi and have been shuffling between Bangalore and Delhi since WFH started post THE Pandemic. I find writing, cleaning and outdoor walks therapeutic (not always in Delhi of course). I started my first blog back in 2003, while clearning and my first walk, well, much before that. I have photographic proofs. I also love to cook sometimes, and watch a whole lot of recipe videos all the time. All in all, what I alluding to is: I am a great husband. Don't need to check with my wife on that. </br></br> I often yearn for the internet of my childhood, so I've decided to liven up this website and try to curate everything 'me' in here instead of different platforms. That means, information on all my projects and work, writings and maybe a few photos and videos. </br></br> Hope to you see you around!</br></br>",
